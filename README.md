Nuun Kernel [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/nuun-io/kernel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nuun-io/kernel)
===========

Nuun IO is a powerful and flexible inversion control micro-framework for building enterprise class stack.

Nuun IO brings a clean kernel/plugin design plus a JSR 330 compliant injection mechanism backed by 
Google Guice. It is designed to be compatible with the major injection frameworks (spring, guice for now, 
tapestry, picocontainer, jodd, etc to come ...). Nuun IO aims to be a future reference for enterprise
application developpement.


Nuun IO makes a clear separation between stack developers and business developpers.
Stack developers will define convention and high level technical aspects by creating plugins.
Then business developpers will be free from configuration and will be able to focus on business
issues not technical issues.
